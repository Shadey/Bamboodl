#Roadmap

This roadmap is a work in progress, and will be filled out as I have time, and suggestions come in. I have prioritized the tutorial pages above this document.

##New Domains

In addition to archiving 8chan/4chan threads, support for Newgrounds (art/music/flash/journals), Tumblr (posts and all media), and various other websites are planned. Not all of them have JSON API's, and their HTML pages must be parsed. This is why Beautiful Soup is a requirement. Even if it is not presently used by Bamboodl, it *will* be, so it's better to require all users to have it in advance, so they aren't surprised by Bamboodl suddenly not working after an update.
