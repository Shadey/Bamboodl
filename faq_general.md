##How EXACTLY does Bamboodl work

When you first run Bamboodl, it looks for its configuration files, located at `~/_python/bamboodl` (`~` being your user directory, `C:/Users/&lt;name&gt;` on Windows, `/home/&lt;name&gt;` on Linux, etc). If they doesn't exist, it creates them on first run, and all intermediate directories. In `bamboodl.json`, you can change the path threads are downloaded to. In the future, the config path will be changed to `~/.python/bamboodl`, but since OSX makes it difficult to access hidden folders I'm holding off until I can add several more features to Bamboodl.

By default, Bamboodl downloads threads to `~/bamboodl`. You can change that in the config file, `bamboodl.json`.

In the future, this project will include an archive browser; an HTML file that you open, and use to browse your local archive as if it was a live imageboard.

There is some additional information, and pictures, on my [personal website](http://daniel.tadeuszow.com/index.html#/projects/bamboodl).
