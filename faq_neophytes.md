##What's Python?

Python is an [interpreted programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language).

What that means, is you have 'python code' in a text file, and a 'python application' that reads the code like a movie script and does what the script says. The script, or code, is in plain English, so you can easily read the code too.

##I'm confused about ~ and directories

If you don't know how to access your home `~` directory, or all this *directory* stuff is kind of a mystery to you, and you're on Windows and just want this stuff to work, open an Explorer window, and on the left side click your C drive. Then double click the 'Users' folder (on XP, 'Documents and Settings'). Then, double click the folder with your account name. There, you're in!

To learn more about what a home directory is, and why I use `~` instead of a full path, check [this Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).
